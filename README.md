Realtime Associates (David Warhol) (GB/GBC/GG) to MIDI converter

This tool converts music from Game Boy and Game Boy Color games using David Warhol (of Realtime Associates)'s sound engine to MIDI format. It also works with the Game Gear version of the sound engine since it uses the same sequence format, which appears to be a modified version of SEGA's US supplied driver.

It works with ROM images. To use it, you must specify the name of the ROM followed by the number of the bank containing the sound data (in hex).
For games that contain multiple banks of music (i.e. Return of the Jedi), you must run the program multiple times specifying where each different bank is located. However, in order to prevent files from being overwritten, the MIDI files from the previous bank must either be moved to a separate folder or renamed.
To specify the system between Game Boy and Game Gear, you use the flag "GB" and "GG". If no such flag is present, it automatically selects Game Boy mode.

Examples:
* RTA2MID "Zoop (U) [!].gb" 4 GB
* RTA2MID "Star Wars - Super Return of the Jedi (U) [S][!].gb" 5 GB
* RTA2MID "Star Wars - Super Return of the Jedi (U) [S][!].gb" 6 GB
* RTA2MID "Zoop (U) [!].gg" 3 GG
* RTA2MID "Super Return of the Jedi (U) [!].gg" 5 GG
* RTA2MID "Super Return of the Jedi (U) [!].gg" 6 GG

This tool was based on my own reverse-engineering of the sound engine, with little disassembly involved. The sequence format happened to be practically identical between Game Boy and Game Gear, so it supports both systems.

The other included "prototype" tool, RTA2MID, as usual, prints out information about each song to TXT.
